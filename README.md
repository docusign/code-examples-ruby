# Ruby Launcher Code Examples

### Github repo: code-examples-ruby

This GitHub repo includes code examples for DocuSign APIs.

To switch between API code examples, modify the `examples_API` setting at the end of the configuration file. Set only one API type to true and set the remaining to false.

If none of the API types are set to true, the DocuSign eSignature REST API code examples will be shown. If multiple API types are set to true, only the first will be shown.

**Note:** to use the Rooms API you must also [create your DocuSign Developer Account for Rooms](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/rooms-api/rooms101/create-account).

## Introduction
This repo is a Ruby on Rails application that demonstrates:

## eSignature API

For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the eSignature API, see the [Required Scopes section](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth).

1. **Use embedded signing.**
   [Source.](app/services/e_sign/eg001_embedded_signing_service.rb)
   This example sends an envelope, and then uses embedded signing for the first signer.
   With embedded signing, the DocuSign signing is initiated from your website.
1. **Request a signature by email (Remote Signing).**
   [Source.](app/services/e_sign/eg002_signing_via_email_service.rb)
   The envelope includes a pdf, Word, and HTML document.
   Anchor text ([AutoPlace](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/AutoPlace-New-DocuSign-Experience)) is used to position the signing fields in the documents.

   [Source.](app/services/e_sign/eg003_list_envelopes_service.rb)
   The envelopes' current status is included.

## Included OAuth grant types:

* Authentication with Docusign via [Authorization Code Grant flow](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/oauth2-code-grant) .
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate.
The **refresh token** is not used in this example.

* Authentication with DocuSign via the [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/oauth2-jsonwebtoken).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note: If you downloaded this code using Quickstart from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip steps 1 and 2 below as they're automatically performed for you.**

1. A DocuSign Developer account (email and password) on [demo.docusign.net](https://demo.docusign.net).
   Create a [free account](https://go.docusign.com/sandbox/productshot/?elqCampaignId=16536).
1. A DocuSign Integration Key and secret key (a client ID). To use JSON Web token, you will need the Integration Key itself, the RSA Secret Key and an API user ID for the user you are impersonating.
   
   You will need the **Integration Key** itself, and its **secret**.

   The Integration key must include a **Redirect URI** of

   `{base_url}/auth/docusign/callback`

   Where `{base_url}` is the url for the web app.

   By default, the rails app starts on url `http://localhost:3000`
   
   So the default Redirect URI for your Integration Key is

   `http://localhost:3000/auth/docusign/callback`

1. Ruby version 2.7.1 or later. Or you can update the Gemfile to use other versions of Ruby.
1. A name and email for a signer, and a name and email for a cc recipient.

### Installation steps
**Note: If you downloaded this code using Quickstart from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip steps 4, 5, and 6 below as they're automatically performed for you.**

1. Download or clone this repository to your workstation to directory **code-examples-ruby**
1. **cd code-examples-ruby**
1. Install the needed gems listed in the Gemfile:

   Run **bundler install**
1. Copy the file **config/appsettings.example.yml** into a new file named **config/appsettings.yml**
1. Update the file **config/appsettings.yml** with the Integration Key and other settings.
     Note: The terms "client_id" and "Integration key" are synonyms. They refer to the same thing.

1. Update your Integration Key's settings to include a **Redirect URI** for
   your installation of the example. See Prerequisites item #2, above for more information.

#### Run the application
1. To start the development web server and application:

   Run **rails s**  

   *Note that on Windows additional actions might be necessary:*
   - *Install sqlite3: **gem install sqlite3 --platform=ruby***
   - *Download curllib.dll (https://curl.haxx.se/windows/)*
   - *libcurl-x64.dll should be copied as libcurl.dll*
   - *Place libcurl.dll into Ruby `C:\\<Ruby installation>\bin`*
1. Open a browser to the example's base url to view the index page.

### Configuring JWT

**Note:** Before you can make any API calls using JWT Grant, you must get your user’s consent for your app to impersonate them. To do this, the `impersonation` scope is added when requesting a JSON Web Token.

1. Create a developer sandbox account on developers.docusign.com if you don't already have one.
2. Create a new API key in the Admin panel: https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key
  - Take note of the _Integration Key_.
  - Generate a _RSA Keypair_ and copy the private key to a secure location.
  - Set a _Redirect URI_ of `http://localhost:3000/auth/docusign/callback` as mentioned in the installation steps above.
3. Create a new file in the config folder named **docusign_private_key.txt**, and paste in that copied RSA private key, then save it.
4. Update the file **config/appsettings.yml** and include the settings from step 2.

[Obtaining consent](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/obtaining-consent#individual-consent) does not need to be configured, as it is already being done in the code at [JwtAuth::JwtCreator#update_token](./app/services/jwt_auth/jwt_creator.rb#L35)

From there you should be able to run the launcher using `bundle exec rails server` then selecting **JSON Web Token** when authenticaing your account.

### Troubleshooting Windows SSL issue
When using the Ruby launcher on a Windows machine you may get the following error:

**SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK**

This error occurs because you’re attempting to use the Ruby launcher with a self-signed certificate or without SSL/HTTP security. The API calls from Ruby SDKs are using a built-in Curl tool that is enforcing the SSL requirement. You can disable this security check to run the launcher in an insecure manner on your developer machine. 

```diff
- It is highly recommended that you don’t disable this security check 
- in a production environment or in your integration. 
- This method is offered here solely as a means to enable you to 
- develop quickly by lowering the security bar on your local machine.
```
Find the root folder for your Ruby gems (in this case, a 64-bit version of Ruby 2.7.0):

C:\Ruby27-x64\lib\ruby\gems\2.7.0\gems\

Find the relevant DocuSign Ruby SDK you are using. The name always starts with “docusign”; for instance, DocuSign Click SDK version 1.0.0:

C:\Ruby27-x64\lib\ruby\gems\2.7.0\gems\docusign_click-1.0.0\lib\docusign_click

Find the **configuration.rb** file in that folder.
Modify the following two lines in the **configuration.rb** file, replacing `true` with `false`:

      @verify_ssl = true
      @verify_ssl_host = true


Once this is complete, you can run your Ruby on Rails application again and you should be able to make API calls on your localhost.


### Payments code example
To use the payments example, create a
test payments gateway for your developer sandbox account.

See the
[PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md](./PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md)
file for instructions.

Then add the payment gateway account id to the **config/application.rb** file.

### Using the examples with other authentication flows

The examples in this repository can also be used with the
Implicit grant OAuth flow.
See the [Authentication guide](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication)
for information on choosing the right authentication flow for your application.
