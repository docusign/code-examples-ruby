# Ruby Launcher Code Examples

### GitHub repo: [code-examples-ruby](./README.md)

This GitHub repo includes code examples for the DocuSign Admin API, Click API, eSignature REST API, Monitor API, and Rooms API. To switch between API code examples, modify the `examples_API` setting in the appsettings.yml file. Set only one API type to `true` and set the remaining to `false`.

If none of the API types are set to `true`, the DocuSign eSignature REST API code examples will be shown. If multiple API types are set to `true`, only the first will be shown.

## Introduction
This repo is a Ruby on Rails application that supports the following authentication workflows:

* Authentication with DocuSign via [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode).
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate. The refresh token is not used.

* Authentication with DocuSign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.

## eSignature API

For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the eSignature API, see [Required scopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth#required-scopes).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 as they were automatically performed for you.

1. A free [DocuSign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/); create one if you don't already have one.
1. A DocuSign app and integration key that is configured for authentication to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).

   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRI4fe5HgM) demonstrates how to obtain an integration key.

   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and a secret key. See [Installation steps](#installation-steps) for details.

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the User ID GUID of the impersonated user. See [Installation steps for JWT Grant authentication](#installation-steps-for-jwt-grant-authentication) for details.

   For both authentication flows:

   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include a redirect URI of

   http://localhost:3000/auth/docusign/callback

   If you host this launcher on a remote web server, set your redirect URI as

   {base_url}/auth/docusign/callback

   where {base_url} is the URL for the web app.

1. [Ruby version 2.7.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or later
   1. Update the Gemfile to use later versions of Ruby.
   1. Windows x64 only:
      1. Ensure that your Ruby folder is appended with **-x64**, e.g. **Ruby27-x64**
      2. Install Curl for Ruby: [Download libcurl.dll](https://curl.haxx.se/windows/)
         Save **libcurl-x64.dll** as **libcurl.dll**
         Place **libcurl.dll** in your Ruby folder, e.g. **C:&#92;Ruby27-x64&#92;bin**


### Installation steps

1. Select your desired code example.


### Troubleshooting Windows SSL issue
When using the Ruby launcher on a Windows machine you may get the following error:

**SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK**

This error occurs because you’re attempting to use the Ruby launcher with a self-signed certificate or without SSL/HTTP security. The API calls from Ruby SDKs are using a built-in Curl tool that is enforcing the SSL requirement. You can disable this security check to run the launcher in an insecure manner on your developer machine.

```diff
- It is highly recommended that you don’t disable this security check
- in a production environment or in your integration.
- This method is offered here solely as a means to enable you to
- develop quickly by lowering the security bar on your local machine.
```
Find the root folder for your Ruby gems (in this case, a 64-bit version of Ruby 2.7.0):

C:\Ruby27-x64\lib\ruby\gems\2.7.0\gems\

Find the relevant DocuSign Ruby SDK you are using. The name always starts with “docusign”; for instance, DocuSign Click SDK version 1.0.0:

C:\Ruby27-x64\lib\ruby\gems\2.7.0\gems\docusign_click-1.0.0\lib\docusign_click

Find the **configuration.rb** file in that folder.
Modify the following two lines in the **configuration.rb** file, replacing `true` with `false`:

      @verify_ssl = true
      @verify_ssl_host = true


Once this is complete, you can run your Ruby on Rails application again and you should be able to make API calls on your localhost.

### Troubleshooting macOS SSL issue
When using the Ruby launcher on OSX you may get the following error:

```
Faraday::SSLError (SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed (self signed certificate in certificate chain))
```
Please update SSL certificates if rvm is your version manager. Or check [other steps for different scenarios](https://gemfury.com/help/could-not-verify-ssl-certificate/#updating-ssl-certificates).
```
$ rvm osx-ssl-certs status all
$ rvm osx-ssl-certs update all
```

## Payments code example
To use the payments code example, create a test payment gateway on the [**Payments**](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=payments) page in your developer account. See [Configure a payment gateway](./PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md) for details.

Once you've created a payment gateway, save the **Gateway Account ID** GUID to appsettings.yml.
