# Configuring a DocuSign payments gateway

DocuSign offers built-in connections to multiple payment
gateways. The payments example uses a demo account via the Stripe
gateway service.

## Creating the payments gateway account

1. Login to demo.docusign.net and go to the Admin Tool.
1. On the Integrations / Payments screen, click Stripe.
1. For development, you can skip the Stripe account application
   by using the `Skip this account form` link:

   ![Skipping the Stripe account form](docs/stripe_skip_account_form_link.png)
1. Next, the Admin Tool will show that an enabled Stripe
   payment gateway account has been associated with your
   DocuSign Developer account.
1. Configure the example launcher with the gateway account id shown in the Admin tool.
